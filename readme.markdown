"myplots" folder readme
========================

This folder contains all the code to plot the LHC optics in 2D. For more detailed simulations (3D plots or tracking of many particles) see FLUKA or SIXTRACK simulations.

* The __"elements"__ folder is a module that creates the input to a python plotting script to plot the LHC elements we choose.
* The __"lhcb"__ folder plots the optics in IP8, using the __"elements"__ output.

An aperture module will be coming soon. For more info read the 'readmes' in each folder.
