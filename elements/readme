ELEMENTS FOLDER README
**********************

The "elements" folder generates the .csv files that the Python script uses to plot elements and apertures, from a MAD-X output (.tfs).
The program will issue .csv files, with only the elements you choose.

*****
STEPS
*****

(1) Put a MAD-X output file (i.e. tfs) in the folder "in" with the following columns (in this order, if you want the plotting script to work properly):

	NAME	S  	L	APER_1	APER_2	APER_3	APER_4	APERTYPE   

	You can add several files to this folder, for example one for beam 1 and one for beam 2.

(2) Open "regex.conf" and write there the elements you are interested in (that's the regex that the program will look for), and below the name you want to add to the output file. The program will issue the .csv file with a name like this: "aperture_b1_nameofelement" and "aperture_b2_nameofelement".

	Example of content of "regex.conf":

MBAW
mbaw
MBLW
mblw
MBRB
mbrb
MBRC
mbrc
MBRS
mbrs
MBW
mbw
MBWMD
mbwmd
MBX
mbx
MBXW
mbxw
MBXWH
mbxwh
MK
mk
MC
mc
MQXA
mqxa
MQXB
mqxb
B
b
V
v
TAN
tan
TAS
tas
TC
tc


(3) Once "regex.conf" is written, you just have to run "run.py", and the .csv files will be generated in the "out" folder. Ready to be easily used by a Python script.
